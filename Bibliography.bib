abstract = {The MovieLens datasets are widely used in education, research, and industry. They are downloaded hundreds of thousands of times each year, reflecting their use in popular press programming books, traditional and online courses, and software. These datasets are a product of member activity in the MovieLens movie recommendation system, an active research platform that has hosted many experiments since its launch in 1997. This article documents the history of MovieLens and the MovieLens datasets. We include a discussion of lessons learned from running a long-standing, live research platform from the perspective of a research organization. We document best practices and limitations of using the MovieLens datasets in new research.},

abstract="Collaborative Filtering (CF), the prevalent recommendation approach, has been successfully used to identify users that can be characterized as ``similar'' according to their logged history of prior transactions. However, the applicability of CF is limited due to the sparsity problem, which refers to a situation that transactional data are lacking or are insufficient. In an attempt to provide high-quality recommendations even when data are sparse, we propose a method for alleviating sparsity using trust inferences. Trust inferences are transitive associations between users in the context of an underlying social network and are valuable sources of additional information that help dealing with the sparsity and the cold-start problems. A trust computational model has been developed that permits to define the subjective notion of trust by applying confidence and uncertainty properties to network associations. We compare our method with the classic CF that does not consider any transitive associations. Our experimental results indicate that our method of trust inferences significantly improves the quality performance of the classic CF method.",

abstract = {Recommender Systems based on Collaborative Filtering suggest to users items they might like. However due to data sparsity of the input ratings matrix, the step of finding similar users often fails. We propose to replace this step with the use of a trust metric, an algorithm able to propagate trust over the trust network and to estimate a trust weight that can be used in place of the similarity weight. An empirical evaluation on Epinions.com dataset shows that Recommender Systems that make use of trust information are the most effective in term of accuracy while preserving a good coverage. This is especially evident on users who provided few ratings.},

abstract="Though research on the Semantic Web has progressed at a steady pace, its promise has yet to be realized. One major difficulty is that, by its very nature, the Semantic Web is a large, uncensored system to which anyone may contribute. This raises the question of how much credence to give each source. We cannot expect each user to know the trustworthiness of each source, nor would we want to assign top-down or global credibility values due to the subjective nature of trust. We tackle this problem by employing a web of trust, in which each user maintains trusts in a small number of other users. We then compose these trusts into trust values for all other users. The result of our computation is not an agglomerate ``trustworthiness`` of each user. Instead, each user receives a personalized set of trusts, which may vary widely from person to person. We define properties for combination functions which merge such trusts, and define a class of functions for which merging may be done locally while maintaining these properties. We give examples of specific functions and apply them to data from Epinions and our BibServ bibliography server. Experiments confirm that the methods are robust to noise, and do not put unreasonable expectations on users. We hope that these methods will help move the Semantic Web closer to fulfilling its promise.",
