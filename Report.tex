\section{Introduction}
I have done my summer internship at METU Data Mining Research Group under the supervision of Prof.Dr.Pınar KARAGÖZ and Prof.Dr.İsmail Hakkı TOROSLU. The task I have worked on was implementing a Trust Based Recommender using the collaborative filtering method and testing it on provided dataset. The dataset contains information about customers and the products they have bought. In addition to dataset, I was able to use eigentrust calculation and community detection modules provided by the TACOREC.

\section{Project}
During the internship, I implemented two different trust based recommenders : Eigentrust Weighted Recommender and Inverse Distance Weighted Recommender. The details of these two recommenders can be found in the section 2.3.

\subsection{Analysis Phase}
There were two problems I need to solve: \\
1 - Dataset was very sparse \\ 
2 - There was no explicit trust information \\
In the both implementations I have made, first case handled by filtering the customers and products which purchased and were bought more than filtering threshold times. To gain better understanding on the second problem, I studied implicit trust calculation methods and looked into lots of research papers.

\subsection{Design Phase}
\subsection{Implementation Phase}
Since there are two different implementations which contains lots of details. I have divided the details of the recommenders into two subsections: section 2.4 and 2.5. Under this subsection, the libraries and the technologies used in implementations are explained.
