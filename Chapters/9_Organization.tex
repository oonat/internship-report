\subsection{METU Data Mining Research Group}
Data mining is a process of extracting special patterns and useful information hidden in the raw data involving methods at the intersection of statistics, machine learning, and database systems.
Data Mining Group is a research group that continues its research on data mining and big data within METU.
The focus of the research group is especially on web mining and multi-relational data mining.\\
