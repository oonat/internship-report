	During the internship, I implemented two trust based recommenders with different weightening methods:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Eigentrust Weighted Recommender
		\item Inverse Distance Weighted Recommender
	\end{enumerate} 
	The details of these two recommenders can be found in section 2.4 and 2.5, respectively.
