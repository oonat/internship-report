	During the internship, I implemented two trust-based recommenders with different weighting methods:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Eigentrust Weighted Recommender
		\item Inverse Distance Weighted Recommender
	\end{enumerate} 
	The details of these two recommenders can be found in section \ref{eigentrust_section} and \ref{inverse_section}, respectively.
