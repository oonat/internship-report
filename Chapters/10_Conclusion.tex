I had the chance to,
\begin{itemize}
	\item recognize the main challenges such as sparsity, scalability, cold start etc. experienced by recommenders 
	\item experience firsthand which types of algorithms are effective and ineffective in solving which problems 
	\item use evaluation methods and understanding which method should be used where
\end{itemize}
For the future,
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Not only customers and products records but extra attributes such as product supplier, platform, product category, seller, store, location, date, etc. can be made part of the system either adding them as nodes to the Graph of Inverse Distance Recommender or using them as an extra filtering layer as in "Hybrid Recommender Systems".
\end{enumerate}
