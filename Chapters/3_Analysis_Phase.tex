The definition and calculation of trust may differ in many sources and researches. For instance, \cite{Eigentrust} approaches the issue from the probabilistic side and calculates trust through successful and unsuccessful transactions while the trust calculation method in \cite{papagelis_article} is based on "Pearson Correlation Similarity" between users. In addition to given examples, there are recommenders\cite{massa_article} which use trust scores explicitly given by users to make recommendations. \\ \\
In our case, although the dataset provided by Stockmount doesn't contain explicit trust information given by customers as in \cite{massa_article}, In addition to transaction records in the dataset, I was able to use "Community Detection" and "Eigentrust Calculation" modules provided by TACoRec. The part I was worked on integrating these "Eigentrust scores" to the recommendation process. \\ \\
For the "Inverse Distance Weighted Recommender", I experienced the difficulty of inferring trust from implicit customer behaviours which was I believe the most meaningful and challenging part of the internship.
