	There were two problems I need to solve: \\
	1 - Dataset was very sparse \\ 
	2 - There was no explicit trust information \\
	In the both implementations I have made, first case handled by filtering the customers and products which purchased and were bought more than filtering threshold times. To gain better understanding on the second problem, I studied implicit trust calculation methods and looked into lots of research papers.
