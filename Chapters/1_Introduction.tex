I have done my summer internship at METU Data Mining Research Group under the supervision of Prof.Dr.Pınar KARAGÖZ and Prof.Dr.İsmail Hakkı TOROSLU. The task I have worked on was implementing a Trust Based Recommender using the collaborative filtering method and testing it on provided dataset. The dataset contains information about customers and the products they have bought. In addition to dataset, I was able to use eigentrust calculation and community detection modules provided by the TACOREC.
