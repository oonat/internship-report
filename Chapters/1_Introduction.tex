I have done my summer internship at METU Data Mining Research Group under the supervision of Prof.Dr. Pınar KARAGÖZ and Prof.Dr. İsmail Hakkı TOROSLU. The main task I have worked on was describing trust between customers and integrating the trust scores calculated by TACoRec\cite{Tacorec} to collaborative filtering algorithm. In addition, towards to end of my internship, I implemented an additional Trust Based Recommender based on a new trust metric.
