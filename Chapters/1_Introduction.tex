I have done my summer internship at METU Data Mining Research Group under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Pınar Karagöz and Prof. Dr. İsmail Hakkı Toroslu. The main task I worked on was describing trust between customers and integrating the trust scores calculated by TACoRec\cite{Tacorec} to a collaborative filtering algorithm. Also, towards to end of my internship, I implemented an additional trust-based recommender system based on a new trust metric.
